For the last couple of months, I've been working a lot on something quite different from my Windows Development expertise: writing .NET Core micro-services with React and Typescript front-end, running on Docker containers in Kubernetes, hosted on Microsoft Azure!

The thing is that the more I worked with React and Typescript, the more I was enjoying it -- to the point that made me think on how I could use my new skills on this blog!

Back in 2017, I [migrated my blog from WordPress to Jekyll](/2017/03/13/migrated-from-wordpress-to-jekyll) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

From that moment my blog became blazing fast and I was fairly happy with the arrangement; plus, as far as I am aware, I had near-zero downtime on the blog!

However, I always felt that Jekyll in GitHub Pages was quite limited in what can be achieved (a simple example is that you can't easily generate a page with all categories or tags).

I started to search for a React-based static site generator, and that's how I found [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com)!

> Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps

A month ago, I started to migrate the blog and today it is all Gatsby based, fully hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (provides free hosting, highly configurable build configuration, custom headers, redirect rules, ...)

This very post if the first of many using the new platform!

As far as I can tell, everything is working properly, but if you find any problem, please report it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/pedrolamas/pedrolamas.com/issues/new) and I'll take care of it as soon as possible!
