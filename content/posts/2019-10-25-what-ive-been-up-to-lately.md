A few months ago, I decided to take a break from UWP development, and since then I've been learning a lot of different technologies while working in new projects!

Don't get me wrong here: I still love to work in UWP and will carry on doing so, but reality is that it's been getting a lot harder to find companies looking for UWP experts to work.

At the same time, I believe there is nothing wrong with expanding your knowledge base by learning new stuff, so here we are!

Since learning React and TypeScript, I've fully [migrated this website from Jekyll to Gatsby](/2019/07/30/migrated-from-jekyll-gatsby/).

I enjoyed [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) so much that I have even contributed with a couple of [PR's](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pulls?q=author%3APedroLamas) and created my first Gatsby Plugin [gatsby-remark-acronyms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-remark-acronyms) (this is also my first npm package ever)!

In my home I have a NanoPi NEO 2 SBC running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) as an all-in-one home automation solution, so I've open-sourced my whole [configuration](https://github.com/PedroLamas/home-assistant-config), including the [Docker configuration](https://github.com/PedroLamas/nanopineo2-docker-config) that hosts it.

This gave me the opportunity to improve my Python skills, and so I have already contributed back with a couple of [PR's](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pulls?q=author%3APedroLamas).

There are a few more projects I'm involved on that I haven't mentioned above, but the more I learn new stuff, the more I think I should make a change to the site description: "~~Windows~~ Development"...
