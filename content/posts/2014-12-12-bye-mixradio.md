Today was my last day as a MixRadio employee.

After [Microsoft completed the acquisition of the Nokia Devices & Services business](/2014/04/25/bye-nokia-hello-microsoft/), MixRadio and all of it's employees became part of Microsoft.

However, a couple of weeks after that Microsoft started a full reorganization and decisions were quickly made to ensure [MixRadio would become a separate entity](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/18/nokia-mixradio-streaming-music-ios-android).

So the only visible changes resulting from the acquisition are actually the company signs around the office, the "blue badges", and the new @microsoft.com email addresses... no other real integration ever happened for MixRadio, so I can't actually say I felt like a Microsoft employee during this short period!

As a result of all this, plans have been made for the future of MixRadio as a new company that made me believe this is the right time for our paths to come apart.

During my time with the company, I was involved in almost every aspect of the MixRadio Windows Phone client development; every time I open the MixRadio 4.x client in my phone, I canâ€™t help but to feel proud of what this team accomplished.

I wish the very best to MixRadio and all my colleagues in the upcoming future, and I'm sure to keep using MixRadio service as it is by far one of the best streaming music services available!

As for me, I will keep doing what I love, always related with development under Microsoft Technologies, but more to come on this over the next weeks...
