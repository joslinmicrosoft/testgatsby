The biggest request (and at the same time, the biggest complaint) I always had about [Cimbalino Toolkit](http://cimbalino.org) was to get some proper documentation about what the toolkit actually contains!

That has now changed, as the documentation is live at [http://cimbalino.org/help](http://cimbalino.org/help)

[![Cimbalino Toolkit Documentation](/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cimbalino-Toolkit-Documentation.png)](http://cimbalino.org/help)

The whole documentation was generated from the inline XML Documentation with the help of [SandCastle](https://sandcastle.codeplex.com/), so it's still a bit minimum but I expect it to improve along time!

Please feel free to check it out and send some comments! :)
