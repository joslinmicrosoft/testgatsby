As I am about to start adding Windows Phone "Blue" support to [Cimbalino Windows Phone Toolkit](http://cimbalino.org), I'm planning to stopping the WP7 support on the 3.x!

The upcoming 4.x would have WP8 and WP Blue support, allowing for a more future prune implementation and dropping the NuGet packages from 9 to just 2 (the Background package as it stands today and a main one with all the rest).

To actually understand the position of the Windows Phone developers about WP7 development, I started a poll that I now invite you to answer! :)
