The deal to transfer substantially all of the Nokia Devices & Services business to Microsoft has now officially been closed.

With it, **I proudly become a Microsoft employee!** :)

I will always cherish the moment I decided in moving to the UK to work for Nokia (even if that stopped any chance of receiving the Microsoft MVP award, but that's another story!).

Nokia made me feel that I could actually make a difference with my work, and I truly appreciate the company for the opportunity!

I've been working with Microsoft technologies for more time than I can remember, both as a user and also as an IT professional, and I consider getting the "blue badge" as a giant career step for me!

In the present moment this doesn't bring any significant changes: I'll carry on working in the MixRadio apps here in Bristol, as I did until today!

Thank you Nokia, it's been really fun... Hello Microsoft! :)
