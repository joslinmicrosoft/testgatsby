In case you've missed it, Microsoft has now released the [Windows 10 Technical Preview Developer Tools](http://dev.windows.com/en-US/windows-10-developer-preview-tools)!

These allow you to start using the Windows 10 Universal Apps Platform (UAP) and thus developing apps for the next generation of Windows!

All you need is a machine (or VM) with the latest Windows 10 Preview and Visual Studio CTP 6 to install the developer tools preview and start building some awesome apps!! :)

## Cimbalino Toolkit Windows 10 UAP support

I've been getting a lot of questions lately about Cimbalino Toolkit support for Windows 10 Apps (aka Universal Apps, UAP, Windows Apps, etc...)

I can assure you that **support is definitely coming** and you can get an early look on what is being done in [Scott Lovegroove's](https://twitter.com/scottisafool) fork available [here](https://github.com/ScottIsAFool/Cimbalino-Toolkit/tree/Win10UAP)!
