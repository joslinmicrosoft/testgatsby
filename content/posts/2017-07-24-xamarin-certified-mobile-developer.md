A couple of weeks ago I decided to enroll into [Xamarin University](https://university.xamarin.com/) and after a few classes and a final exam, I'm now a **Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer**!

I love Windows Development and make no mistake: I intend to keep writing and working with full native UWP!!

But at this time it makes complete sense for someone who works with XAML and C# to also learn Xamarin, as this is the best Microsoft has for cross-platform development!

Xamarin University was a really good experience and I can definitely recommend it to everyone: people that just started coding with .NET and C#, experienced developers who want to learn Xamarin, or professional developers that just want to get Xamarin certified!
