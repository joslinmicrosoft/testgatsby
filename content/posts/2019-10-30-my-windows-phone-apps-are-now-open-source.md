As Windows Phone has been [dead and buried](/2017/07/10/windows-phone-is-officially-dead/) for a while now, last weekend I uploaded all assets and source-code for my old Windows Phone 7.x and 8.x apps to GitHub, some of them never before published!

Here's the list of the new repos:

- [PedroLamas.JogosSantaCasa](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.JogosSantaCasa)
- [PedroLamas.OtherSide](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.OtherSide)
- [PedroLamas.Quadratic](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.Quadratic)
- [PedroLamas.TheBroCode](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.TheBroCode)
- [PedroLamas.Vencimento](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.Vencimento)
- [PedroLamas.WP7.CTTObjectos](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.WP7.CTTObjectos)
- [PedroLamas.WP7.MetroNoPorto](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.WP7.MetroNoPorto)
- [PedroLamas.WP7.UnitConverter](https://github.com/PedroLamas/PedroLamas.WP7.UnitConverter)

All content is available under MIT license, but please bear in mind that I've built these a while back and so I give no guaranties that these are in working order!
