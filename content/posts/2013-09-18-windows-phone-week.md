[![Windows Phone Week](/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Windows-Phone-Week.png)](https://wpcommunityweek.eventday.com/)

Directly from the [official site](https://wpcommunityweek.eventday.com/):

> Windows Phone Week is a series of events created for the developer community by Windows Phone Developer MVPs.
>
> The events are in nine countries, encouraging developers from around the world to explore app and gaming development.
>
> Each event has a unique agenda, format and registration process so please check the details at the location nearest you.

Although at this stage only 9 countries are participating, there are plans to expand to other territories, so stay tuned! ;)
