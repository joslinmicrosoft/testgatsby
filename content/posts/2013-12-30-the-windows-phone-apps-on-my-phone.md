So you got a brand new Windows Phone device for Christmas and still don't know what to install on it?

Then look no further: here is the list of the best apps I have installed on my own phone! :)

## Social

- [Twitter](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=0b792c7c-14dc-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) - The fully featured Twitter app with multiple account support and push notifications that actually do work!
- [Facebook Beta](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=93da5d29-daf0-4783-9ed5-a87b33247ec6) - There is also a non-beta [Facebook](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=82a23635-5bd9-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) official app, but I prefer the beta one as it gives me the latest features sooner! ;)
- [4th & Mayor](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=c7d13b8d-9951-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) - I know that there is an official [Foursquare](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=26cf3302-469f-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) app and that it's a lot better than the first version, but I still prefer 4th & Mayor from Jeff Wilcox as it is quite simpler and uses a more direct approach!
- [WhatsApp](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=218a0ebb-1585-4c7e-a9ec-054cf4569a79) - free messaging that works on pretty much any phone? Yes, thank you very much! :)
- [Skype](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51) - The official Skype app, really good when it actually works... this is the one app I really need and sometimes fails me miserably :\
- [6tag](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=7d795cdf-fb1b-4bdf-8f5e-76eb19f7079e) - developed by Rudy Huyn, probably the best Instagram app for Windows Phone. There is an official [Instagram BETA](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=3222a126-7f20-4273-ab4a-161120b21aea) app, but it's still lacking some features...
- [Disqus](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=93c35e04-5d4d-42d2-aaaa-3bd1532443b2) - It's probably the most used network for commenting on forums and blogs everywhere!
- [LinkedIn](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=bdc7ae24-9051-474c-a89a-2b18f58d1317) - LinkedIn official app, to keep in eye on your professional connections.
- [Viber](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=3d051f9b-9e03-456f-b647-bea34fe7031c) - Another VOIP app, quite known out there

## Tools + Productivity

- [Authenticator](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b) - In a time where security and privacy are lacking more and more, using two-factor sign-in whenever possible does help a bit (Microsoft, Google, and other websites use this approach)
- [Google](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=220bfbf2-ee02-496c-a656-651a6c0c6518) - not that different than accessing www.google.com with the browser, but nevertheless it's the **only** app that Google has on Windows Phone...
- [Adobe Reader](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=134e363e-8811-44be-b1e3-d8a0c60d4692) - Official Adobe Reader app to open PDF files on the phone. There is also a [PDF Reader](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=8f6154d6-1b70-431a-a579-b6a43477e837) from Microsoft as a really good alternative.
- [BoxFiles for Dropbox](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=5d7f992b-ee03-e011-9264-00237de2db9e) - There are quite a few Dropbox apps right now for Windows Phone (none is official) and I personally like this one.
- [SkyDrive](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ad543082-80ec-45bb-aa02-ffe7f4182ba8) - full featured official SkyDrive app from Microsoft.
- [GDrive](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=c945c809-5e5d-4db3-b4c9-70c8cebd5235) - Using Google Drive? Then this is what you need! It's not a fully featured client, but at least it is better than nothing!
- [TeamViewer](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=afadc741-961a-4677-b490-c1777bdfe9e5) - Access your machine remotely using TeamViewer.

## News + Weather

- [Nextgen Reader](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=643381de-4724-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) - this is the #1 app in my phone!!! I just couldn't go by without reading my RSS feeds, and given it uses [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com) as source, all my feeds are synchronized; just perfect!!
- [Amazing Weather HD](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=c7ac43c5-5d99-4e65-913d-e92e253e9e99) - A really good weather app with nice look and quite a few features. A free alternative is [Bing Weather](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=63c2a117-8604-44e7-8cef-df10be3a57c8), also quite nice!

## Lifestyle / Shopping

- [Amazon Mobile](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=351decc7-ea2f-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) - Search Amazon, purchase stuff, check your order status...
- [eBay](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=92d3a3a3-66d9-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) - The app is quite simple and could use a better look, but it works well and does a proper job alerting when auctions are about to end.

## Travel + Navigation

- [Geosense](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=7ca9cfea-1b92-4ca4-8559-269936d5361e) - quite useful to convert from different GPS coordinates types, to get my location, open KML files from Google Earth... and yes, **I wrote it** and that's also another reason why it's here, so sue me! :P
- [TripAdvisor](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=180b0f46-e753-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) - I always like to read the reviews on hotels and restaurants on TripAdvisor before I actually go to the place.
- [Currency](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=dc5f12fa-b49d-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) - Currency exchange, provided by [XE](http://www.xe.com/)

## Entertainment

- [IMDb](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ff971299-eed8-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) - The official IMDb app for Windows Phone, probably the best showcase for a WP app and the best IMDb client you'll find in any mobile device!
- [Helium Voice Free](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=da4c75d6-df50-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) - Because it's fun and I like to show kids! :)

## Business

- [Office Remote](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=01f53e5a-7870-49cb-8afc-d6fab6d7a3cd) - do you do PowerPoint presentations? Then do yourself a favor and install this in your Windows Phone!

## Personal Finance

- [PayPal](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=75738196-1db2-49d9-afb1-d66a34d19fb6) - I like to keep a close eye on my PayPal transactions!

## Photo

- [Pictures Lab](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=5db119bf-7ad5-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) - Nice, clean, and fast, picture effects app, developed by Ren√© Schulte.
- [Tile Me!](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=4b113087-6abc-40fb-8e49-d02adeba1393) - Create a Windows Phone tile picture with this app, and use it everywhere! :D

## Music + Video

- [YouTube](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=dcbb1ac6-a89a-df11-a490-00237de2db9e) - a couple a months ago there was an official YouTube app (and it was really good, I might add), but Google pulled the plug on it and so we are stuck with just this miserable plugin and YouTube mobile website...
- [Shazam](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=2f8d5271-2b81-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) - You know when you're in a party, listening to a music that you actually like and don't know who the artist is? That's when Shazam comes quite handy!
- [Sax](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=b3690063-6d30-43aa-9934-84a99781fa34) - A simple fun way of playing saxophone without one!

## Books + Reference

- [Wikipedia](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=fd40c569-2681-48df-9ff3-53ffd80aa9b5) - it's Wikipedia, and that is all anyone needs for reference...

So go on now, install some apps in your phone and have fun!

And by the way: Happy New Year!!! :)
