Version 3.2.3 of [**Cimbalino Windows Phone Toolkit**](http://cimbalino.org) is now available!

As [previously indicated](/2014/03/15/poll-what-are-your-plans-for-wp7dev/), this will probably be the last version still supporting Windows Phone 7...

Here's the change log starting from version 3.2.0 to the current 3.2.3:

- **v3.2.1**
  - New **WebRequestExtensions**
  - Ensured that `MarketplaceInformationService` doesn't cache the results
- **v3.2.2**
  - New **EventHandlerExtensions**
  - Improved the `MultiBindingBehavior` by adding the missing `Mode` property
  - Improved the `ShellTileServiceTile` to enable tiles update with XML data
  - Fixed a couple of issues on `MarketplaceInformationService` related to "beta apps"
- **v3.2.3**
  - New **SaveRingtoneService**
  - New **ScreenCaptureBehavior**
  - New **FrameworkElementExtensions**
  - DeviceInfo, Location, and UserInfo components can now be used inside Background Agents
  - Improved `ShellToastService` to add the custom sound support

There are other improvements and bug fixes not stated here, but also quite important too! :)
