You've been playing with Visual Studio Express for a while, creating some new cool apps and games for Windows Phone, and now you want to publish them but the \$99 USD price tag on the developer account seems a bit steep!

Well, how does \$19 USD sound like? :)

Until the end of August, that's the current subscrition fee for a one year WPDev account (plus taxes)!

And in case you already have an account, **you can renew your current account for the same price**, as Joe Belfiore himself stated in a tweet just minutes ago!
