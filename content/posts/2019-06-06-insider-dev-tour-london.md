Microsoft is hosting the Insider Dev Tour London on **June 18th, 2019** from 8:00 to 17:30 at the [Vue Cinema in Leiceiter Square](https://goo.gl/maps/BLWkFPbfqFpjMV748).

You can expect a lot of content around building Microsoft 365 experiences (Windows, Graph, Office, Teams), no matter your skill as a developer.

I will be there to talk about **"Developing with the new Edge Browser"**, and there will be quite a few familiar faces talking about other topics too!

More details and registration are available [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/campaigns/uk-london)!
