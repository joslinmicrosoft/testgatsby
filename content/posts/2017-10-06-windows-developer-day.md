On October 10, Microsoft is hosting the [Windows Developer Day](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/09/14/windows-developer-day-returns/) here in London, and you can watch the live stream starting at <time datetime="2017-10-10T16:30:00Z">9:30 AM PDT</time>.

The event will start with a keynote by Kevin Gallo and members of the Windows engineering team, followed by a live-streamed Q&A session and several streaming sessions diving deeper into what's new for developers in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.

You might also want to check if there's a viewing party in your area (check on the bottom of [this post](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/09/14/windows-developer-day-returns/)).

## And if you're around London on the next day...

... come to the next [Windows Apps London](https://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/) meetup at <time datetime="2017-10-11T17:30:00Z">6:30 PM on October 11</time> and meet the Windows engineering team!

This is a relaxed in-person event, where you'll get to ask a few more questions after the main Windows Developer Day!
