## About

The Windows Phone 8 development team added a set of 36 icons to the SDK to be used on the Application Bar by developers of external applications.

This number seemed quite low to get things done, even more after seeing the other icons spread across the native Windows Phone 8 applications (like the “send” icon on the messages, the “attach” icon on the mail app, etc.)

Thus, I now present you a collection of **99 extra icons** in comparison to the 36 that comes on the SDK (please click on the image below to get a full size visualization of the collection)

Most of these icons are the original ones that show up in the Windows Phone 8 apps (extracted from the application resources), others where simply modified to get the correct measures (changing the “canvas” to 76x76, the right size for this type of icons).

The icons are here free of charge, all I ask is that you please link to this page and not directly to the file! ;)
