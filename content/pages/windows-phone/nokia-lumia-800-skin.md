## About

Windows Phone emulator uses a basic skin showing a generic device, but we can find many alternative skins on the internet, like the [Nokia Lumia 710](http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/posts/11-10-26/welcome-nokia-lumia-wp7-emulator-skin.aspx) from [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/), and the [Samsung Focus](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/12/my-new-windows-phone-emulator-theme/) from [Jeff Wilcox](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/).

Following up on them, I looked for one of the Nokia Lumia 800, but the (many!) skins I found looked quite bad, result of using low resolution images...

So, I created my very own Nokia Lumia 800 skin for Windows Phone emulator, and the result is what you can see here! :)

This skin uses hi-res images, and has the following fully working buttons:

- Back/App switcher
- Start/Speech
- Search
- Volume Up
- Volume Down
- Camera

Note: though the "Power" is present and does the expected animation(!), this doesn't seem to work on the Windows Phone emulator!

## Install

Here's what you need to do to use this skin:

- Make sure the emulator is closed!
- Open the emulator folder (normally should be something like “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\1.0\”)
- Create a backup of the “WM7_Skin.xml” file just in case you want to go back to the old skin
- Extract the files to the emulator folder (note: requires administrator access)
- Start the emulator!
