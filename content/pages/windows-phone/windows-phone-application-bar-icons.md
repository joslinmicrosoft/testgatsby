## About

The Windows Phone 7 development team added a set of 32 icons to the SDK to be used on the Application Bar by developers of external applications.

This number seemed quite low to get things done, even more after seeing the other icons spread across the native Windows Phone 7 applications (like the "send" icon on the messages, the "attach" icon on the mail app, etc.)

Thus, I now present you a collection of 132 extra icons in comparison to the 32 that comes on the SDK (please click on the image below to get a full size visualization of the collection)

A large part of these icons are really the original ones that show up in the Windows Phone 7 apps (extracted from the application resources), others where simply modified to get the correct measures (changing the "canvas" to 48x48, the right size to this type of icons).

**Note:** On the previous image, the icons with a white rectangle indicate that they where extracted from the Windows Phone 7.1 files!

The icons are here free of charge, all I ask is that you please link to this page and not to the file per say! ;)
