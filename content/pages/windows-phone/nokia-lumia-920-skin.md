## About

Following up on my previous [Nokia Lumia 800 skin](http://www.pedrolamas.pt/windows-phone/nokia-lumia-800-skin-en/) for Windows Phone emulator, I now bring you my very own Nokia Lumia 920 skin, and the result is what you can see below! :)

This skin uses hi-res images, and has the following fully working buttons:

- Back/App switcher
- Start/Speech
- Search
- Volume Up
- Volume Down
- Camera

Note: though the "Power" is present and does the expected animation(!), this doesn't seem to work on the Windows Phone emulator!

## Install

Here's what you need to do to use this skin:

- Make sure the emulator is closed!
- Open the emulator folder (normally should be something like “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\1.0\”)
- Create a backup of the “WM7_Skin.xml” file just in case you want to go back to the old skin
- Extract the files to the emulator folder (note: requires administrator access)
- Start the emulator!
