My name is Pedro Lamas, Iâ€™m a Portuguese software development consultant specialized in Microsoft technologies living in London UK, and this is my blog where I regularly write mostly about Windows Development.

I'm a [Microsoft Certified Professional](mcp-transcript), a [Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer](/2017/07/24/xamarin-certified-mobile-developer), and a former [Microsoft Windows Development MVP](/2017/03/02/awarded-microsoft-windows-development-mvp-2017)!

I like contributing to all types of open source software, and I'm the author of the [Cimbalino Toolkit](http://cimbalino.org).

I just love telling people how .NET is the best thing just after freshly brewed coffee!
